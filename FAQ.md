###Q: Is this mod compatible with [server running tool or wrapper]?

A: The mod is compatible strictly with Minecraft Forge client and server.




###Q: Will you be adding Clone Wars, Rebels, Old Republic, etc. content?

A: Prequel Trilogy Content takes precedence over the animated shows/other games, no timelines yet.




###Q: Where are purple lightsabers and Jar Jar and Battle Droids and Clones?

A: Not yet added.




###Q: Choose jedi or sith? Class system?

A: Maybe, but it won't be what you think. There most likely won't be a GUI.




###Q: Add Jedi and Sith NPC's and have them spawn and stuff!!

A: NPC's are tied to structures, so unless we have a Jedi Temple during the time of the Galactic Republic, you won't see any Jedi roaming the dimensions.  As for Sith, there were only ever 2 Sith at a time and were extremly hard to find so you probably won't ever see any Sith roaming around in the wild either.




###Q: Will this mod work with [some other mod]?

A: We can't guarantee compatibility with everything, but we would like to make PSWM as compatible as possible so give it a try with whatever you want to, and if it doesn't work, post an issue to our GitHub.




###Q: 1.8?

A: Not right now.




###Q: Factions!

A: We want the player to be free and choose their own path, not chain themselves down to one specific person or race because we don't see the fun in that.  That being said, there will be some sort of gameplay advantages/disadvantages to playing certain ways/doing certain quests/doing certain actions/talking to certain NPC's.




###Q: Can I have a sarlacc pet?!

A: Definitely not.




###Q: Can you make the guns 3D?

A: We like them not being 3D, having them be 3D would stray a little too far from the vanilla feel for us, not to mention the countless hours of modeling and texturing for such a small feature.




###Q: Lasers shouldn't catch things on fire, the lightsaber animation hurts my eyes, you shouldn't get water buckets from water droplets, and I keep getting weird Dimension ID crashes!!!

A: Look at our config file (`starwarsmod.cfg` located in the `.minecraft/config/` folder), all of these things and more are optional and changable on a per-user basis.
