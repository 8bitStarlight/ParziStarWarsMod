###Q: What version does the mod use?

A: 1.7.10, and you need Minecraft Forge for 1.7.10 too!




###Q: Is this mod compatible with [server running tool or wrapper]?

A: The mod is compatible strictly with Minecraft Forge client and server.




###Q: I want to work with you guys what can I do?

A: If you have examples of your work somewhere public online and we see it and want to work with you, we'll contact you.  But we aren't necessarily looking for people to add to the team, sorry.




###Q: Will you be adding Clone Wars, Rebels, Old Republic, etc. content?

A: Prequel Trilogy Content takes precedence over the animated shows/other games, no timelines yet.




###Q: Where are purple lightsabers and Jar Jar and Battle Droids and Clones?

A: Not yet added.




###Q: Choose jedi or sith? Class system?

A: Maybe, but it won't be what you think. There most likely won't be a GUI.




###Q: Add Jedi and Sith NPC's and have them spawn and stuff!!

A: NPC's are tied to structures, so unless we have a Jedi Temple during the time of the Galactic Republic, you won't see any Jedi roaming the dimensions.  As for Sith, there were only ever 2 Sith at a time and were extremly hard to find so you probably won't ever see any Sith roaming around in the wild either.




###Q: Will this mod work with [some other mod]?

A: We can't guarantee compatibility with everything, but we would like to make PSWM as compatible as possible so give it a try with whatever you want to, and if it doesn't work, post an issue to our GitHub.




###Q: 1.8?

A: Not right now.




###Q: Factions!

A: We want the player to be free and choose their own path, not chain themselves down to one specific person or race because we don't see the fun in that.  That being said, there will be some sort of gameplay advantages/disadvantages to playing certain ways/doing certain quests/doing certain actions/talking to certain NPC's.




###Q: Can I have a sarlacc pet?!

A: Definitely not.




###Q: Can you make the guns 3D?

A: We like them not being 3D, but maybe.




###Q: Lightsabers should deflect blaster bolts and make crashing noises when they hit another lightsaber that's blocking!!

A: They already do, we promise.




###Q: Lasers shouldn't catch things on fire, the lightsaber animation hurts my eyes, you shouldn't get water buckets from water droplets, and I keep getting weird Dimension ID crashes!!!

A: Look at our config file (`starwarsmod.cfg` located in the `.minecraft/config/` folder), all of these things and more are optional and changable on a per-user basis.
