###Q: What version does the mod use?

A: 1.7.10, and you need Minecraft Forge for 1.7.10 too!



###Q: Can I use this in a modpack or video?

A: Go right ahead, only if you put the appropriate credit ([link](http://parzivail.com/mods/tswm/) and a mention to Parzi's Star Wars Mod). Thanks!




###Q: Is this mod compatible with [server running tool or wrapper]?

A: The mod is compatible strictly with Minecraft Forge client and server.




###Q: I want to work with you guys what can I do?

A: If you have examples of your work somewhere public online and we see it and want to work with you, we'll contact you.  But we aren't necessarily looking for people to add to the team, sorry.




###Q: Will you be adding Clone Wars, Rebels, Old Republic, etc. content?

A: Prequel Trilogy Content takes precedence over the animated shows/other games, no timelines yet.




###Q: Will you be adding AT-AT's and AT-ST's?

A: AT-AT's might be a bit much in-game if we made them canon-correct size so we're gonna have to say a soft no on that for now.  AT-ST's are something we can actually do without them looking out of place so you could probably expect to see those at some point.




###Q: Can you add flyable and fully explorable star destroyers?

A: The short answer is no, and the long answer is too long.




###Q: Speaking of new content when is the next update and what are you adding?

A: Go look at the Next Update Info tab on our site for info and a few small spoilers about new content.  As for when, we're always working so it's just whenever we feel the next release has enough content and is stable enough to be called a release that we actually put out a new version.  Usually though you're looking at a little over 2 months between major versions, and it could be slightly longer depending on the amount and complexity of things we're adding.




###Q: Where are purple lightsabers and Jar Jar and Battle Droids and Clones?

A: Not yet added.




###Q: Choose jedi or sith? Class system?

A: Maybe, but it won't be what you think. There most likely won't be a GUI.




###Q: Add Jedi and Sith NPC's and have them spawn and stuff!!

A: NPC's are tied to structures, so unless we have a Jedi Temple during the time of the Galactic Republic, you won't see any Jedi roaming the dimensions.  As for Sith, there were only ever 2 Sith at a time and were extremly hard to find so you probably won't ever see any Sith roaming around in the wild either.




###Q: Double lightsabers, pls?

A:
> "We've got to give him more time!" - *Lando Calrissian*



###Q: Will this mod work with [some other mod]?

A: We can't guarantee compatibility with everything, but we would like to make PSWM as compatible as possible so give it a try with whatever you want to, and if it doesn't work, post an issue here on our GitHub.




###Q: 1.8?

A: Not right now.




###Q: Factions!

A: We want the player to be free and choose their own path, not chain themselves down to one specific person or race because we don't see the fun in that.  That being said, there will be some sort of gameplay advantages/disadvantages to playing certain ways/doing certain quests/doing certain actions/talking to certain NPC's.




###Q: Can I have a sarlacc pet?!

A: Definitely not.




###Q: Can you make the guns 3D?

A: All of the Original Trilogy guns are, any other guns still 2D are currently being 3Dified.




###Q: How do you do/use "insert feature/action/mechanic"?

A: Take a look at our wiki, it'll probably clear some things up.




###Q: Why are ships "buggy"?

A: They're not, they just fly faster than most chunks can load/reload if you have your render distance set too high. Try turning down your render distance and start your flight above some area you've already loaded/played in.  A little frame drop should be expected, but if you have your settings right it shouldn't be that noticeable.




###Q: Where are main character armors like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren?

A: Not yet added.




###Q: Add Jakku and Starkiller Base and more Sequel Content!!

A: We have a lot of content across all of the trilogies planned, please bear with us.




###Q: Lightsabers should deflect blaster bolts and make crashing noises when they hit another lightsaber that's blocking!!

A: They already do, we promise.




###Q: Lasers shouldn't catch things on fire, the lightsaber animation hurts my eyes, you shouldn't get water buckets from water droplets, and I keep getting weird Dimension ID crashes!!!

A: Look at our config file (`starwarsmod.cfg` located in the `.minecraft/config/` folder), all of these things and more are optional and changable on a per-user basis. *HOWEVER!* If your config file if different from the server's config file, bad things will happen. If this is true, contact your server administrator and ask them kindly for a copy of the config file.
